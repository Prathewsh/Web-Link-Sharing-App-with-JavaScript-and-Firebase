# Shortened Dynamic Links Web Application

This web application allows users to create and share shortened dynamic links to websites. 
It prompts users to enter a website link, generates a short dynamic link using Firebase Dynamic Links, and provides an option to share the link using the Web Share API if supported by the browser. 
Otherwise, users can manually copy the link.
